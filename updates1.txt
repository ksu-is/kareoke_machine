1. tried out many pitch matching algorithms
	a. average pitch for every 0.25 seconds
	b. matching notes with in a 5-millisecond range
	c. consider multiple cases for silent beats found in either audio file.
	d. combination of b. and c.

2. Wrote a function that filter out white noise based on the placement of the frequency

3. Spliced out extra samples from the beginning and end of the audio such that audio file is easier to grade (i.e. extra frames = instrumental intro where no vocals are heard)

4. Researched and Worked on lyric matching
	a. updated the speech recognition function and threaded it so that it can detect speech while the person is singing instead of analyzing the audio file
